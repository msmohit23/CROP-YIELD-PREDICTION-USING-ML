# 🌾 Crop Yield Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

Agriculture is the backbone of the global economy, and accurate crop yield forecasting plays a crucial role in ensuring food security, sustainable farming, and resource optimization. This project presents a machine learning-powered platform that predicts crop yields based on historical agricultural data, soil properties, and real-time climatic variables.

The system empowers farmers, agricultural experts, and policymakers to make data-driven decisions, optimize planting schedules, improve resource management, and adapt to changing environmental conditions.
